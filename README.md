The objective of this project was to design a stochastic model predictive controller instead of a regular PID based controller and investigate error reduction in waypoint navigation. The whole system is based on ROS architecture and the simulation platform used is the physics engine Isaac-sim 5.0. Two different types of terrain, smooth plane and rough plane, were used to see the difference and how SMPC deals with the difference in terrain uncertainties. To test the motion, a 20m x 20m waypoint trajectory was selected with the robot velocity of 1.5m/s. The values used in this model are what are used in the robot used at Farmslab. Robot momentum and wheel slip are typically the core uncertainities kinematic models fail, which validated the use of physics engine capable of dynamic modeling and a stochastic controller to minimize such errors. We used a P-controller as a comparative baseline. From the experiment in Isaac sim, using same environment and same waypoint trajectory, reduction in root mean square error was observed with the use of SMPC by about 67% in rough terrain. Although the error difference was almost none in a perfectly smooth plane.
